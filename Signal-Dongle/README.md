Signal Dongle
=============

This is the main repo for the portion of the signal app that will be running on a remote device.
It contains the handshake and encryption logic, and the code for playing audio.

There's no build framework in place, so remember to download these necessary dependencies
https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html

Then, navigate to Signal-Dongle/lib directory and run
git clone git@github.com:hosseinmay/AudioInterface.git
